# Install
Have Python3 installed via Anaconda or through the Python website. 
Install requirements in the file with 

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Model 
Our game model takes advantage of the MobileNet pretrained model and applies it to our frames.
We are processing our frames through OpenCV and using a Caffe model version of the MobileNet.

MobileNet in this repo has been used in the following projects, we recommend you to take a look:

The MobileNet neural network using Apple's new CoreML framework hollance/MobileNet-CoreML

Mobile-deep-learning baidu/mobile-deep-learning

Receptive Field Block Net for Accurate and Fast Object Detection ruinmessi/RFBNet

Depthwise Convolutional Layer yonghenglh6/DepthwiseConvolution

MobileNet-MXNet KeyKy/mobilenet-mxnet
